A Java Software for reading a remote database, containing information on movies, and their cast.
The software itself consists of the following functions: finding movies and actors by their name, listing the cast of a movie and listing all movies which
featured a specific actor or actress. The user can rate the movies on a 1 to 5 scale, and has a favorite-movie list,
which they can manipulate.
